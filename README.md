# SongRecommendationEngine

By utilizing the Million Song Dataset (MSD), we tried different algorithms for a music recommendation system in order to evaluate them for performance. In this project, we compare the popularity model, item-based collaborative filtering model, item-based model with Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), and k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN). For evaluating machine learning models we computed the F-1 score for popularity model and k-NN, while root mean squared error (RMSE) for popularity, item-based and SVD models. We concluded that the item-based model with SVD performed the best for music recommendation amongst the algorithms implemented. 

# Motivation
Music is something that almost everyone can relate to and music recommendation systems are now common on platforms such as Youtube or Spotify. By exercising different machine learning techniques on a skeleton music recommendation system, we gain a deeper understanding of the various techniques and their application to personalize music. We can draw our own conclusions on the best implementation for a music recommendation system on the basis of various performance metrics and compare it to the existing literature. Thus this type of project is method based.
